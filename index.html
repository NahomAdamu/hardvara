            <p>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often called the "brain" of the computer. It is a microprocessor that executes instructions from programs, performs calculations, and manages the flow of information through the system. The CPU interprets and carries out basic instructions that operate the computer, making it essential for running software, managing hardware, and performing tasks from simple arithmetic to complex decision-making. Its speed and efficiency directly impact the overall performance of the computer.</p>

            <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is the short-term memory of a computer, temporarily storing data and instructions that the CPU needs while performing tasks. Unlike storage drives, RAM is volatile, meaning its contents are lost when the computer is powered off. Having more RAM allows a computer to run more applications simultaneously and handle larger files, improving multitasking and overall responsiveness. RAM is essential for smooth operation in gaming, content creation, and everyday computing.</p>

            <p>The graphics card, or GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images and video intended for output to a display. Unlike the CPU, which handles general-purpose tasks, the GPU is optimized for parallel processing, making it ideal for rendering complex graphics, running visual effects, and handling large amounts of data simultaneously. Modern GPUs are crucial for gaming, video editing, 3D rendering, scientific simulations, and powering technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning. A dedicated graphics card can significantly improve a computer's visual performance and enable support for multiple high-resolution monitors, virtual reality, and advanced graphical features.</p>
